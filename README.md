# 📂 My_Projects  

Welcome to my **Data Analysis & Automation Projects** repository!  
This is a collection of real-world projects where I apply **Python, SQL, data pipelines, and automation** to solve practical problems and improve data workflows. Each project demonstrates my skills in **data cleaning, analysis, reporting, and validation**.

## 🚀 About This Repository  

In this repo, you’ll find projects covering:  

- **Data pipelines & automation** → Automate repetitive tasks and ETL workflows.  
- **Annotation & QC validation** → Ensure accuracy of human or AI tagging.  
- **Data tracking & visualization** → Monitor usage, progress, and performance with dashboards.  
- **SQL & BigQuery analytics** → Advanced queries, aggregation, and coverage metrics.  

All projects are designed to be **portfolio-safe**, using **mock or simulated data** when real data cannot be shared.

## 📁 Projects Overview  

Here’s a quick look at the projects included in this repository:  

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [🎯 Taggers Qualification](./taggers-qualification) | End-to-end pipeline to evaluate **annotators and new QC members**, with golden datasets, task creation, and performance analysis (confusion matrices, precision/recall, error reports). |
| [📊 Automated Annotation Tracker](./Patch_Report_Automation) | Automates annotation validation in Dataloop, identifies taggers, and updates BigQuery tables efficiently. |
| [✅ LabelCheck Validation](./labelcheck-validation) | Weekly proportional sampling of manual tags, human-in-the-loop validation, and tracking of tagger and QC accuracy. |
| [📈 Datapoints Usage Tracker](./datapoints-usage-tracker) | Tracks daily datapoint usage across projects, pushing results to Google Sheets and Looker Studio dashboards. |
| [🌿 Weeds Tagging Coverage (SQL)](./weeds-tagging-coverage) | SQL analysis of weeds tagging coverage by counts and coverage score, with metrics for client, crop, and field. |
