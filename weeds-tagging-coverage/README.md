# üå± Weeds Tagging & Coverage Analysis

## üìñ Description  
This project focuses on **measuring the quality of weed tagging** in crop imagery and understanding the **proportion of identified vs. unidentified weeds** across fields.  

Using advanced SQL queries, it combines multiple data sources to generate **weed coverage reports** for different crops, clients, and fields.  

The pipeline measures weeds in **two ways**:  
1. **Annotation counts per label** ‚Äì Counts the number of manually tagged weeds for each species.  
2. **Weed coverage score** ‚Äì Calculates coverage per weed automatically based on field-level annotations (`global_insights`).  

It produces a **comprehensive report** linking weed counts, coverage scores, and field metadata, helping identify areas with **low identification rates** and enabling targeted re-annotation to improve dataset quality.  

All examples here use **realistic data**, but the workflow can be adapted for **portfolio-safe datasets**.

## üöÄ Why This Matters  
Accurate weed tagging is essential for both **AI model training** and **field-level decision-making**:  

- ‚úÖ **Evaluate tagger performance** ‚Äì Detect where weeds are being missed or mislabeled.  
- ‚úÖ **Understand field coverage** ‚Äì Identify fields or crops with high proportions of unidentified weeds.  
- ‚úÖ **Enable targeted re-annotation** ‚Äì Focus on fields with low identification rates to improve dataset quality.  
- ‚úÖ **Support agronomy teams** ‚Äì Provide actionable metrics for crop management and reporting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Demonstrated  
- Writing **modular SQL queries** with CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
- Extracting and parsing nested data from **JSON fields**  
- Conditional aggregation (`CASE WHEN`) to calculate metrics  
- Using **window functions** (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER`) for deduplication  
- Joining multiple tables for integrated reporting  
- Calculating **percentages and coverage scores** across clients, crops, and flights

## üìä Use Case / Workflow  
1. Measure the proportion of unidentified weeds in **two ways**:  
   - By counting the number of annotations per label.  
   - By calculating the **weed coverage score** automatically.  
2. Analyze results **by client, organization, country, crop, and flight date**.  
3. Filter fields with **low unidentified proportions** to understand gaps.  
4. Optionally **re-annotate** these fields to increase identification quality.  
5. Generate reports to track improvements over time.

## Project Workflow
1. **Weed counts**: Aggregate the number of tags per category from `Eti_Images_Crops_Subcat_Jira_Master_Table`.  
2. **Coverage scores**: Extract species-level scores from JSON stored in `global_insights`.  
3. **Join metadata**: Combine tag counts and coverage scores with project, field, and crop information.  
4. **Compute derived metrics**: Percentages for identified/unidentified weeds and broad/grass categories.  
5. **Produce final report**: A comprehensive dataset per order with both counts and coverage scores.

## How to Use
1. **Run the query in BigQuery** against the `BI_MASTER_TABLES` and `BI_POSTGRES` datasets.  
2. Adjust category IDs (`158`, `212`) to match your internal tagging taxonomy.  
3. Optionally, export the results to CSV or visualize in **Looker Studio** for further reporting.
