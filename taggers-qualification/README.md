# 🎯 Taggers & QC Qualification – Weed Annotation

**End-to-end pipeline for evaluating annotation quality and performance in weed annotation projects.**  

---

## ❓ Why This Project Matters

In many agricultural AI projects, the **accuracy of human annotations**—like identifying weeds in crop images—directly affects the quality of AI models and the insights derived from them.  

This project addresses that challenge by providing a **reproducible and automated pipeline** to:  

- Ensure a **high-quality “golden dataset”** of weed images for benchmarking.  
- Evaluate annotators consistently and fairly.  
- Assess new QC members to ensure the review process itself is accurate.  
- Identify **patterns of errors or inconsistencies** in tagging.  
- Generate actionable reports for improving both **human and AI workflows**.  

---

## 🛠️ Core Workflow

The project consists of **three main steps**:

### 1️⃣ Build Golden Dataset
- Extract images and metadata from existing AI datasets.
- Assign **unique IDs** and organize images into a “golden” dataset for evaluation.
- Ensures a clean and controlled dataset for benchmarking human or AI annotations.

**Key skills:** Data wrangling, APIs, automation, dataset versioning.

---

### 2️⃣ Create Qualification Tasks
- Select images for each tagger based on labels and sampling strategy.
- Create controlled annotation tasks in Dataloop for specific tagger companies or users.
- Updates metadata and file paths to ensure consistency.

**Key skills:** Python scripting, random sampling, workflow automation, API usage.

---

### 3️⃣ Analyze Results
- Aggregate annotation results and compare them against the golden dataset.
- Generate **confusion matrices**, **precision/recall per label**, and error reports.
- Outputs can be exported to Google Sheets for dashboards or reporting.

**Key skills:** Data analysis, Pandas, NumPy, visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), reporting automation.
